# SQL Analysis Project with Sales Data

## Overview
Welcome to the **SQL Analysis Project with Sales Data**! This project focuses on analyzing and deriving insights from online sales data using SQL. The analysis covers various aspects of sales performance, including revenue, product categories, customer demographics, and regional performance. By utilizing advanced SQL queries, this project demonstrates the power of relational databases in analyzing sales data and helping businesses make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Perform in-depth analysis using a range of SQL techniques like **aggregation**, **joins**, **window functions**, and **grouping** to uncover patterns in the sales data.
- **Data Relationships**: Analyze and join sales data with customer demographics to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior and product performance.
- **Complex Reporting**: Generate custom reports like **total revenue by region**, **top-selling products**, and **monthly revenue trends** using advanced SQL functions.
- **Interactive Data Analysis**: Use various SQL filters and aggregations to explore the data and extract tailored insights, ideal for decision-makers.

## Data Source
The dataset for this project is based on **sales data** that includes transactions, product details, customer demographics, and regional information. The data is organized into two main tables, **sales** and **customer_demographics**, which are linked via the **transaction_id** to enable comprehensive analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Used for querying and analyzing sales data.
- **PostgreSQL or MySQL**: Relational database management systems for storing and querying the data.
